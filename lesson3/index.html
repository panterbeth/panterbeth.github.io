    <h3>Site Purpose</h3>
    <p>
        The purpose of this website is to inform people about the local weather in their area. It serves 
        to help them plan their day and activities. Are they going for a hike, swim, bike ride on this 
        beautiful sunny day? Or are the better off staying in with the high chance of rain? 
        This website also has a section for community events that are updated based on weather conditions. 
        It also serves as a place to be informed about coming storms and how to be prepared and to find 
        information about emergency situations such as blackouts and where to go in a weather crisis such 
        as flooding or lightening storm. Are you hosting a public event that you want others 
        to know about? Everyone who checks the weather will see your event posted here.
